# Consumer engagement

Date: 2021-10-29

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Farmacy Family will manage community engagement and create connections between similar demographics.

## Decision

We will use **NCR Consumer data management (CDM)** to support manage customer engagement and track analytics between different demographics. CDM is a solution that serves as the centralized source for consumer master data. It provides a way to maintain consumer information, remove duplicates or inconsistencies, and propagate the data across all applications within an organization. CDM has a specific demographic data management feature we will utilize to make these demographic connections.

Data will be gathered from registration on the Farmacy Family website and relayed to CDM to storage and management. The CDM service will also handle customer loyalty sign-ups for Farmacy Family further increasing engagement through a loyalty/rewards program.

## Consequences

Users may not like the collection of their personal data into the CDM system and either do not sign up or enter fake information.
