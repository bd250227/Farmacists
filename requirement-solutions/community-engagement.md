# Community engagement solution overview

## Requirement

Support both push and pull models for community engagement. In other words, Farmacy Family will manage forums, emails, and create connections between similar demographics. Farmacy Family needs transactional member information for outreach purposes. The engagement model includes subscriptions, forums, reference material, class information, and other media that supports Food-as-medicine.

## Solution

It is expected that the Farmacy Foods solution will submit transactions to the NCR Transaction Document Manager (TDM) Service. By analyzing the transactional data against user data in the NCR Customer Data Manager (CMD) Service clinitians can view via looker what users have similar geography and dietary needs. Because CDM has contact information including email address for each user, custom group invitations can be given for the most appropriate social media platform such as facebook. The will allow clinicians to be open for questions and allow messages to be sent to the group or individual level (push and pull models). 

By being in the specific groups users get automatically subscribed to the news feed. For sharing reference material, classes, and other media, helpful links can be posted in the groups.
