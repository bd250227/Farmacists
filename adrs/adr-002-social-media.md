Accepted

## Context

Farmacy Family will support both push and pull models for community engagement. In other words, Farmacy Family will manage forums.

## Decision

We will use [hootsuite](http://hootsuite.com/) to support our social media presence in a world where there are many mediums for social media. Hootsuite will allow us to manage multiple social media accounts all from one UI. It will provide the push and pull marketing models for community engagement Farmacy Family needs to be successful.

Social media platforms that Hootsuite will manage for Farmacy Family:
* Facebook / Meta
* Twitter
* Instagram
* YouTube
* LinkedIn
* Pinterest

## Consequences

Hootsuite is not free and comes with a subscription cost. If we tie in all of social media to one tool it may be hard or impossible to switch to another similar social media managing tool.
