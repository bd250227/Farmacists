# Record architecture decisions

Date: 2021-10-27

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to show geographic trends of the contents of smart fridges.

## Decision

We will use [Looker](https://www.looker.com) and Big Query from Google. 

## Consequences

Leveraging pre-built geographic views will save project time.

**Positive:** Geographic views are already made.

**Negative:** Looker has subscription costs.

**Risks:** Skillset to use Looker may be high.

**Bonus Features:** The Looker platform keeps evolving with improvments.
